Status:

First release of base::Glob.  Suggestions/bug reports/patches greatly 
appreciated.

Description:

This module allows you to extend base.pm to form IS-A relationships 
with the use of globbing patterns on packages in the symbol table.

Installation:

base::Glob has dependencies on these modules, all available from CPAN:

 Text::Glob      - see the Text::Glob POD for types of glob to use
 Devel::Symdump  - used to walk the symbol table and find packages
 Sub::Uplevel    - to trick base::import into letting us mangle @_

Usual CPAN installation rules apply:

 perl Makefile.PL 
 make
 make test
 make install

There is documentation - including sample usage - in Glob.pm itself.
